# Netflow

Analyzing all of your local subnet's traffic is a great way to get insights which hosts talk to each other using what protocol/app, or how much traffic the hosts on the network consume. Also able to show some network-level issues.

## Requirements

- Ability to either work in a mirrored port-mode (when it gets the traffic via switch-port-mirroring) or in a router mode (when the machine itself acts as a network router and therefore sees everything)

## Contenders

- [NtopNG](https://www.ntop.org/) - The king of this domain
