# CAdvisor

[Container Advisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor) is Google's initial container metrics collector daemon.

## The setup

Alloy is a more modern approach, but it requires clients to be able to write into the server (Prometheus, Loki, etc). CAdvisor is able to provide metrics and can be scraped, so it is ideal in situations when the central solution is not reachable from the outside.

I use it on my VPS, where the VPS is not yet able to reach the central monitoring stack.

## Prerequisites
