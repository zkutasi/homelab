# Security

All kinds of security tools... because it is important to protect against malicious attacks, and protect the infrastructure and the data stored on it.

## Definitions

### IDS (Intrusion Detection System) & IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)

The prime focus of an IDS is in identifying threats and sending out alerts when they are detected. It is mainly a passive system. They are useful to monitor real-time control systems, for example, that need to run continuously and with high availability. An IPS takes this a step further and takes measures, some proactive and some in near real time, to prevent and stop these threats from harming the network and computing infrastructure. This quick action can also limit the spread of malware across a network and prevent data leaks from happening.

### SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

These systems enable real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. It aggregates log data from any source, correlates and alerts on recognised patterns. Often they cover compliance for various security, auditing and governance processes.

### VAS (Vulnerability Assessment System)

A vulnerability assessment is a systematic review of security weaknesses in an information system. It evaluates if the system is susceptible to any known vulnerabilities, assigns severity levels to those vulnerabilities, and recommends remediation or mitigation, if and whenever needed.

### WAF (Web Application Firewall)

A web application firewall (WAF) is a specific form of application firewall that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web service. By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attacks exploiting a web application's known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and improper system configuration.

### XDR (Extended Detection and Response)

Like an evolution of a SIEM, focusing not just on log collection and analysis, but handles also network traffic, email gateways or even cloud services. Often utilizes machine learning, behaviors and anomaly detection and does not rely on log-patterns. It incorporates also real-time actions too (immediate block of the IP for example)
