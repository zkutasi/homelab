# Reverse Proxies

A reverse proxy further helps by eliminating the need to remember port numbers: An FQDN now can be assigned to a host+port, simplifying things further.

## Requirements

- Automation-friendly, possibly has an API too
- Useful to have a GUI, but at least some metrics for Grafana to show
- Easy to set up, not requiring many moving parts

## Contenders

- [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) - The number one modern solution, modular, simple
- [Traeffik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) - Popular proxy based on labeling and auto-discovery
- [Nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx) - The world's most popular Web Server, high performance Load Balancer, Reverse Proxy, API Gateway and Content Cache.
- [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) - A modern, CNCF backed solution
- [Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) - A fan favourite in the homelabbing community, a pre-bundled docker image for easy reverse proxying with NGinx. A tradeoff is it is GUI-oriented only. The development pace is not the greatest.
- [NPMPlus](https://github.com/ZoeyVid/NPMplus) - A fork of NPM with lots of new features
- [HAProxy](https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy) - A very fast and reliable reverse-proxy offering high availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications.
- [SWAG](https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/2020-08-21-introducing-swag) - A bundle from LinuxServer.IO, using Nginx, Php7, Certbot (Let's Encrypt client) and Fail2ban.
