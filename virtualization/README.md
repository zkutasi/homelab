# Virtualization

In order for one host to better utilize its resources, and provide much better isolation for a homelab setup, some kind of Virtualization is essential. TO be able to run more types of OS-es (Linux and Windows), more flavors, test different versions and experiment.

## Requirements

- Free and Open source, preferably 0$ cost

## Contenders

- [VMWare VSphere](https://www.vmware.com/) - Also known as ESXi Originally one of the first good alternatives, lately it went up in price and the components it requires are a bit too much. However it blasts some serious features.
- [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/) - The most versatile Virtualization Environment for homelabs
- [XCP-ng](https://xcp-ng.org/) - A solution based on XenServer from Citrix
- [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/) - A Specific OS for NAS workloads
- [Hyper-V](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-technology-overview) - From Microsoft, for Windows machines as hosts mostly
- [KVM](https://linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) - Vanilla Linux VMs in the Kernel, but does not have a GUI, so a steep leraning curve
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - From Oracle
