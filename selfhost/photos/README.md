## Requirements

- Handles folders as is, does not modify the source pictures
- Face recognition, tagging
- Timeline view, map view, albums

## Contenders

A good comprehensive collection of such apps can be found [on this comparison github page](https://github.com/meichthys/foss_photo_libraries).

- [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/) - Viewing, categorization, tagging, albums. Pretty basic stuff only. No map view. No android app.
- [Damselfly](https://github.com/Webreaper/Damselfly) - AI/ML image recognition, tagging, geolocation, complex filtering. The interface seems a bit dated.
- [Ente](https://ente.io/) - Facial recognition, albums, e2e encryption of photos (!), and tons of other features. The stack is complicated with PostgreSQL and Minio as well as the Ente container (Museum is the Server and Web is the UI) are required.
- [HomeGalery](https://home-gallery.org/) - Face recognition, geolocation, tagging, similar images, query language, map view, etc... Handles 100k images no problem. The interface is fast, but not as intuitive as the modern apps. No existing folder handling.
- [Immich](https://immich.app/) - The most loved app out there for this. 1:1 copy of the feel of Google Photos (timeline, endless scrolling, etc), with extra features like map view. Development is at break-neck speeds, expect non-compatible changes often.
- [LibrePhotos](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos) - Face and object recognition, timeline view, album generation, reverse geocoding, advanced filtering. Development quite weird, many-many issues open for years now, not many new issues reported. Demo instance has no photos loaded.
- [Lychee](https://lycheeorg.dev/) - Beautiful and simple image viewer, has no extra features, just view images. No existing folder handling (everything is lumped together with random filenames?). Missing face recognition. Very infant project with lots of missing things.
- [PhotoPrism](https://www.photoprism.app/) - Another big contender. Search filters, maps, face recognition, auto-classification. No real mobile app, just 3rd party ones.
- [PhotoView](https://photoview.github.io/) - Timeline view, albums, map view, face recognition. And that's it. Simple app.
- [Piwigo](https://piwigo.org/) - Categorize, tag and handle 100k photos with ease. Does not feel like a modern app, more like those photo-sites where you look at tiny pictures with left/right arrows and lots of ads on the border.
