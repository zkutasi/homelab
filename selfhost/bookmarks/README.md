# Bookmarks & save-for-later apps

These kind of apps help you to organize bookmarks outside of your browser, and most of them provide a way to extract the websites offline, to preserve it locally.

## Requirements

- Give some ability to better organize my bookmarks in a centralized place, preferably something that is app-agnostic
- Browser extension to add bookmarks directly from the browser (save and load also)
- Import/Export
- Video preview thumbnails

## Contenders

- [Linkding](https://linkding.link/) - A self-hosted bookmark manager designed to be minimal, fast, and easy to set up. Tag manually, import/export. Browser extension to add, REST API and RSS feed support.
  - [Linkding injector](https://github.com/Fivefold/linkding-injector) - A Browser extension to add linkding bookmarks into the Google searches as an extra
- [Karakeep (ex Hoarder)](https://karakeep.app/) - Quickly save links, notes, and images and karakeep will automatically tag them for you using AI for faster retrieval.
  - [Hoarder pipette](https://github.com/DanSnow/hoarder-pipette) - Same as Linkding injector but for Karakeep
- [Shiori](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori) - Intended as a simple clone of Pocket. [No import functionality yet](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori/issues/771). No tagging, no organization.
- [Linkwarden](https://linkwarden.app/) - Collect and annotate webpages. Also saves a copy of each webpage as a Screenshot and PDF.
