### Scrobblers

It is sometimes beneficial to have your listening taste analyzed, by forwarding what music you listen to. This is called scrobbling. The process can be set up in each of the music listening apps/servers. Then the online scrobbler website can list your favourites, lets you explore their catalog, or even recommend to you new similar artists.
