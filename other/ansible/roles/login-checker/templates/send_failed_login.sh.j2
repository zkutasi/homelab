# This script when put inside /usr/local/bin for example will send failed login attempts via a push message
# Requirements:
#    - properly set up send_push.sh
#    - Add the following line into /etc/pam.d/common-auth:
#      auth    [default=ignore]                pam_exec.so seteuid /usr/local/bin/send_failed_login.sh
#    - Also increase the success counter to jump over this line also in case of success
